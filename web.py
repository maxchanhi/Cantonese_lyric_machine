For example, the medium rising tone (2) may be glided higher than the first tone at the end, and the low tone (4) is sometimes not glided downward. To better distinguish between tones, the starts of tones 2, 4, 5, and 6 are set to different pitches, adding more melodic characteristics when singing.""")
